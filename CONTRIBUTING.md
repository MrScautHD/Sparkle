===================

Ready to dive into Sparkle and make contributions? You're in the right place!

## Pull Requests Welcome

Sparkle is an open-source project, and we eagerly welcome Pull Requests from capable coders like you! Your assistance is invaluable to us.

To ensure smooth integration, please adhere to the following guidelines when submitting Pull Requests:

1. Commit with a clear, descriptive name that reflects the aspect you're addressing.
2. One Pull Request per commit, please. Mixing unrelated commits in a single Pull Request can be confusing for us.
3. If you're fixing something not listed in the issues or not immediately apparent, provide explanatory comments detailing your changes.
4. Respect our code style; you can familiarize yourself with it by examining existing sources.

While Pull Requests not meeting these guidelines are still appreciated, they may require manual merging. Consequently, automatic accreditation as the author in the changelog cannot be guaranteed.

All Pull Requests are subject to Sparkle's license. For details on the legal aspects, refer to our [license documentation](https://github.com/MrScautHD/Sparkle/blob/main/LICENSE).
